# Design Progress Document
This document outlines the progress for the following design:

**Name:** 3 slot VMEbus backplane with active and passive termination

**Revision:** 1

**Date:** January 2024

## Status
| Item | Progress |
|--|--|
| Schematic | Complete |
| PCB layout | Complete |
| PCB build | Not started |
| Functional testing | Not started |
| Further revision | Unknown |

The overall status for this design is: **Stable**

## Notes
This design is considered stable even though the PCB build and functional testing have not been completed. This is because the 8 slot backplane was derived from the 3 slot design, and it has been built and tested. I therefore consider this design to be functionally equivalent other than the number of slots.
